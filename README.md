# Hello 👋 I'm Shafayetur Rahman

---

I am a MERN stack developer. I love to code and learn new things. I am specially focused on front-end development. I have great skills in REACT JS and NEXT JS. I also use framer motion for animations as I love moveable, playful websites. Along with this, Tailwind CSS, Material UI, and Chakra UI are my favorite CSS libraries. 🚀
